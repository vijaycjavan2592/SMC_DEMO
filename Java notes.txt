Function and method are same.

3 types of veriable :
Local
Instance/ Global/ Non static
If u have access the instance vaiable or method then we have to creat instance of that class.
Memory location heap memory.

Global/ststic/class variable
Memory location class memory.
No need to creat the instance of that class.

String Manuplation -->>
indexOf
LastindexOf
compareTo
compareToIgnoreCase
Concat
length
replace,replaceAll,replaceFirst
startWith , endwith
split
subString , subSuquence
charArray


class - collection of multiple objects or its blueprint
Instence - Type of class which refer to object
Object - Holds datamember 

Inheritance : 
Accessing the datamember in parent into child class.
'extends' keywords used.
Single
Mutilevel
Hierachy


Polymorphism :
One task can perform in many way(one to many).
Compile time Polymorphism - Method overloading , 
Run time polymorphism - Method overriding - Dynamic binding

Method overloading/Compile time Polymorphism : 
It is with in same class.
Same method name with different number of parameters
Same class , same method , same no of parameters but order is different.
Smne class , same method name, data type is different.
Return type does not matter.

Run time polymorphism - Method overriding - Dynamic binding
Always outside of class
Support to inheritance.
Whole signature should match then method overriding happens.

Encapsulation
Binding the Data 
Using the getter and setter and public method we can acces the private method.


Abstraction
Hiding the data.
If any method is abstract then it is abstract class.
Only decleration no implementation.
Supports Inheritance and overriding , multipale inheritance.
Instance can not create of abstraction class.(But by using oerride we can create it)
*Need to mentation abstract keywords in front of any method.


Assignment
cearte class empdetails 3 abstract method emp code, name and age 
I have empcode which extends empdetails
calling class which print code age and name


Interfaces : 
100% abstraction means by default all methods are abstract.
*No need to mentation abstract keywords in front of any method.


Class to Class - extends
Class to Interface - implements
Interface to interface - extends



Constructor :
Same as class name.
No return type.
It can overload.
-Default
-Parametrized
-copy Constructor
-Constructor chaining
(super always be first.)


Access Modifier : 
public
private
default
protected

Class can be private and protected.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exception Handling : 
Checked Exception-Compile timr Exception
Unchecked Exception - Run time Exception

throws are used to handle the checked exception.

Code within try block is called proteced code.

finally block always executes.


SELENIUM

Selenium automate bowser.
It is an API, open source.
Works on different brwser.

Locators : 
ID
ClassName
Xpath,
Css
linkText
PartialLinkText


WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   - driver is type of WebDriver which is refer to firefoxdriver.

Selenium commands : 

get();
navigate.to();
backward();
forward();

getText();
getAttribute();  -  it give runtime value of that attribute and its return type is String.

How to check browken URL - 
String expectedURL = "www.abc.com/home";
String actualURL = driver.getCurrentRrl();


For scroll the page there is no webelement so we use JavascriptExecutor.
(JavascriptExecutor)driver.executscript("argument[0].scrollbar",scrollpage);

FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile();
profile.setPreference("browser.startup.homepage", "https://google.com")

To set the browser size
org.openqa.selenium.Dimension d = new org.openqa.selenium.Dimension(420,600);
driver.manage.window().setSize(d);

switchTo();

MouseOver command
action.contextClick();

TestNg- it is basic setup for the test case execution

Difference between BeforeTest and beforesuite?
What are the Hierachy of testng?

TestNG support attribute.
Priority - execute TC in mentation order.
Invocation count - WE set the no of times to the TC.
Description = we can write the description of TC.
DependsOnMethod - No need to call or write same code multitimes.
enable - we setting the TC execution(if enable = false then TC will not execute).
groups - We can execute the TC which we have grouped. And this is advantage over the JUnit(In JUnit group annotation not available).


Asssert and Verify.
Asser.assertEquals(actual, expected) - Asser is class , assertEquals is static method and Asser.assertEquals(actual, expected) this is method overloading concept. 
Assert - if TC fail then it terminates.
Verify - if TC fail then it will continue the execution.
assertTrue , assertFalse , Asser.assertEquals(actual, expected)


CheckPoint - isenable , isdisplayed,
